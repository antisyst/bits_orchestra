## I will be happy if you read it

  `during the development of the project, I was not in good health, that is, I was very sick, so I could not devote much time to the project, and I am currently in the process of recovery. It took me about 40 minutes to less than an hour to complete the task, if I had enough time I could have made the project at a higher level, but due to time constraints this is unfortunately not possible. Moreover, due to my health, it is impossible to show my full potential.`
